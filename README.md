<b>All TODO's were completed.</b>

Student: Christian Zaccaria - SSD Year 2

This app has many functions that perform some sort of analysis on the colours list.


- Some of the many functions:
  - getAll() 
  - numberOfColours()
  - firstColour()
  - coloursStartingWithLetter()
  - coloursWithSpecificNumberOfChars()

- Functions I added:
  - coloursInReversedAlphabeticOrder()
  - coloursEndingWithLetter()
  - colourInTheMiddleOfList()
